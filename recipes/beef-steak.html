        <li>1 Knorr Beef Cube</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ lemon</li>        
        <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine beef, soy sauce, juice from ½ lemon, and ½ teaspoon cracked peppercorn in a bowl. Mix well. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat cooking oil in a pan. Fry each side of the marinated beef for 1 minute. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using the remaining oil (you can add more if needed), sauté half of the onion and add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Put the beef in the pan once the onion softens. Sauté for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 ½ cups of water into the pan. Cover and let the liquid boil.</li>
        <li>Add Knorr Beef Cube. Cover the pan and then adjust the heat to a low setting. Cook for up to 40 minutes. Note: add more water as needed.</li>
        <li>Add remaining onion and season with cracked peppercorn and add brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce thicker by pouring-in the slurry. Do this by mixing cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce gets thick enough, you may turn the heat off and transfer your Filipino Style Beef Steak to a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve with warm rice. Share and enjoy!</li>
